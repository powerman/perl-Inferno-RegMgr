Inferno::RegMgr version 0.1.3

Using OS Inferno registry(4) is simple, but in case connection to registry
become broken (because of network issues or even registry restart) you
have to manually reconnect to registry and restore state (register your
services once again, find out changes in services you're using now, etc.).
Inferno::RegMgr will do this work for you automatically.
